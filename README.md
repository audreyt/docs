![Solid Pay!](.gitbook/assets/solidlogo.png)

**Solid Pay** is a payment system for the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid) framework.  It is built heavily on the [webcredits](https://webcredits.github.io/spec/) specification which allows for Credits between counter parties.

Outlined in this guide are general concepts, user stories and technical details for creating and interacting with payment systems on under Solid. 

Solid Pay is not a crypto currency it is a higher layer technology that lives above existing currencies.  However, Solid Pay, itself, is currency agnostic and any currency is usable with it.  

Being a higher layer protocol it is capable of thousands or even millions of transactions per second, instantaneously and at zero cost.  The aim is that this will facilitate new use cases and business models.

Anyone with a solid pod or that is a solid user can participate, without needing a wallet, however, it should be backwards compatible with the existing web.
