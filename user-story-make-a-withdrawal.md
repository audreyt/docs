# User Story : Make a Withdrawal

### User Story

Withdrawals can be orchestrated by someone in the system with a balance.  It is a bad idea to store any funds on a server, as it invites hackers.  A hot wallet may be a solution but suffers from the same limitation.  A better solution might be have withdrawal requests sent to trusted notaries who verify the size and the request, then process based on cold storage, or a hardware wallet.
