# User Story : Make a Withdrawal

### User Story

Withdrawals can be orchestrated by someone in the system with a balance.  It is a bad idea to store any funds on a server, as it invites hackers.  A hot wallet may be a solution but suffers from the same limitation.  A better solution might be have withdrawal requests sent to trusted notaries who verify the size and the request, then process based on cold storage, or a hardware wallet.

### Process

Withdrawals happen in the reverse way to deposits.  However, it requires the owner of the HD wallet to process via cold storage.  A fee market for competitive withdrawals can emerge, or it could be a community service.  Ultimately it should become more cost effective to spend funds via solid pay, than withdrawing to lower layers.
