# User Story : Paywall

### User Story

A pay wall is an access controlled piece of content. Sending a micro payment to the right place can open up the content. Solid is well suited to such use cases with its ACL system.

### Process

_This is a work in progress_

A user encounters a URI and is unable to access via a 4xx error code \(402 is ideal, but it will be possible to polyfill\).
